# 🙌 Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing!
Postact values **clarity**, **maintainability**, and **human understanding** of the codebase.

## General guidelines
- Keep changes focused and minimal: You may submit a reasonable amount of pull requests, but each of them must be towards a clear & focused goal.
- Follow existing code style and conventions: Make sure to split different parts with a reasonable amount of spaces/new lines.
- Write code you can understand and explain: If names/operations aren't self-explanatory, you can add comments with `//`. Feel free to chat.
- Be respectful in discussions and reviews: Literally.

## AI-Generated content
AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor) are **allowed in code**, but **must be disclosed**.

If any part of your contribution is substantially generated by AI, you **must** wrap that content in the following markers:

```html
[ai-generated content]
<AI-generated code or text>
[/ai-generated content]
````

### What constitutes AI-generated content?
Any of the following:

- Code written or heavily suggested by AI
- Documentation or comments generated by AI
- Refactors or rewrites produced with AI tools
- AI tool dependencies (such as `PROMPT.md`, `.cursor/`, and more)[^1]

Minor assistance from traditional language servers do not apply.

### Why is this required?
Clear disclosure helps maintainers review code more effectively, ensure long-term maintainability and avoid unclear licensing or authorship issues.

**Undisclosed AI-generated content may result in**:

- A request for changes (such as adding the `[ai-generated content]` tags or modifying the code itself)
- Rejection of the pull request (which is completely turned down)

## Questions
If you're unsure if something needs disclosure, feel free to ask [@AWeirdDev](https://github.com/AWeirdDev) in the pull request.
